# Pokémon Dictionary

This is a dictionary containing not translations but mappings between the Japanese and English names of Pokémon, moves, items etc. It is intended to be used with the Android app [Aard 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=itkach.aard2).

If you find yourself missing something, or if you find any mistakes, please open an issue! I especially appreciate contributions in this format:

```
ピカチュ|Pickachu
こうげき|Attack
```

## Installation

Install Aard 2, then download `pokemon_jap_eng.slob` to your device. From the app, go to the dictionary tab, press the "+" icon, and locate the `pokemon_jap_eng.slob` file. Now you can search in either Japanese or English!
